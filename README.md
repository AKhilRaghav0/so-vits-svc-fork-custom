# so-vits-svc-fork-custom

This is a custom repository of so-vits-svc-fork, an open-source project for vocal separation. In this custom version, we have added additional features such as a vocal separator and a data set creator. The main advantage of this custom version is that it can be used directly in a Colab notebook without the need for UVR (Universal Vocal Remover) for vocal removal.

## Features

- Vocal Separator: This feature allows you to separate the vocals from a given audio file. It uses advanced algorithms to isolate the vocals and provide a separate audio file containing only the vocals. The vocal separator is implemented using Gradio, which provides a simple and intuitive user interface for interacting with the vocal separation functionality.

- Data Set Creator: This feature enables you to create custom data sets for training and testing purposes. It provides a user-friendly interface to select and organize audio files, making it easier to generate data sets for machine learning models.
